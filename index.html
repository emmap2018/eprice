    <br>
    <br>
    <p> I currently work at Island Records as the Commercial & Streaming Manager, based in London. Island Records launched over 55 years ago in Jamaica, and is one of the most revered and respected labels in the world. Its unique ethos has provided the platform for launching some of the biggest artists from across the musical spectrum, including the UK launch of Amy Winehouse, Florence + The Machine and Mumford & Sons. Island Records is a subsidary label of Universal Music.
      <br>
      <br>
As Commercial & Streaming Manager, amongst a host of other responsibilities, it's my job to lead day to day relationships with key physical and digital business partners, including Apple Music and iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, Deezer, YouTube Music and more. Whilst working at Island, I've worked on campaigns from global superstars including Drake, Ariana Grande, The Weeknd, Post Malone and U2 to UK signed talent such as Mumford & Sons, Ben Howard, Robyn, Oh Wonder, Catfish & The Bottlemen and Sean Paul to up and coming, developing artists such as Sigrid, Dermot Kennedy and Easy Life. Prior to working at Island Records, I worked at Decca Records and Caroline and Fiction, all labels part of Universal Music.
      <br>
      <br>
         Whilst I've enjoyed my time working for Universal Music, as I approach my 5 year anniversary working with the company, I know that it's not what I want to do forever. Having spoken to friends who have re-trained as coders, and having given a lot of thought to re-training as a coder, I know it's what I want to do. Getting on to the best course around, Founders & Coders, would be a dream come true.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm on a three month notice period for my current job, so I would love to speak to you at your earliest convenience.
